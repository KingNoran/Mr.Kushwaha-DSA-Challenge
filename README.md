# DSA-Challenge
This is a personal challenge where I try to finish this Data Structures and Algorithms sheet in just a span of a month (or less)! This is to prepare for my internship hunt this July.

## Rules

*For every problem solved, increment a point to the counter.*

*I must watch and complete at least two algorithms in one day. Failure to solve the problem should be recorded and documented for the reason (a point must be skipped).*

*No google, no chatgpt, no cheating!*

*However, if I do get stuck on one problem for too long (let's say, a day spent on just one problem), I can peek at the solution.*

Current Milestone: Learn the Basics (0/31)
